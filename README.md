# MIPS-simulator
Making some basic assembly programs

# The assignment has 3 parts
-  a MIPS assembly program to print the input string after saving it to the heap.
-  a MIPS assembly program to perform an iterative binary search to check if an element exists in a sorted array.
-  a MIPS assembly program to perform a recursive computation of x^n.
